# virtualtheatre
An AR application that displays motion capture data.

## Building the project
This project was made with Unity3D version 5.3.1f1. I ave not tried building it with other more recent versions of Unity, so your milage may vary. Older versions of Unity can be downloaded at [Unity's archive](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive).

## Release
On the [Releases](https://github.com/fvcaputo/virtualtheatre/releases) tab for this repo I have included as a v1.0 the two .apks built from the project. One is to display a pre-recorded animation and the other displays a live motion tracking session. For both the live session and to record the tracking you should use the project at [kinectbodytracking](https://github.com/fvcaputo/kinectbodytracking), which already saves the data in a format readable by this application.
